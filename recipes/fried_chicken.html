        <h1>Garlic Fried Chicken</h1>
        <img src="friedchicken.png" />
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This actually uses my breading for Chicken Fried Steak---my husband
            suggested we try it with chicken breasts, and it was delicious!
        </p>
        <p>
            One day, I will be proficient enough in cooking to be able to cook
            this without any help.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - punded thin</li>
            <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a shallow dish, mix together the garlic poweder, pepper salt,
                paprika, bread crumbs and flour. In a separate dish, whisk
                together the milk and egg.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat the oil in an electric skillet set to 350 degrees F (175
                Degrees C). Dip the chicken into the egg and milk, then dredge
                in the dry ingredients until evenly coated.
            </li>
            <li>Fry chicken in the hot oil.</li>
